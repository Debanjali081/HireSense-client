You are a professional career advisor and interviewer. Based on the provided resume text and the job role "${role}", generate the following:

1.  **Personalized Interview Questions (Minimum 8 questions):**
    * In-depth questions about the projects mentioned in the resume, focusing on architecture, challenges, specific technologies used, and outcomes.
    * Questions related to the skills listed in the resume (e.g., specific programming languages, frameworks, databases, tools), assessing practical application, understanding, and problem-solving.
    * Behavioral or situational questions relevant to the role, drawing insights from their experiences.

2.  **Top 5 Companies to Target for this Role:**
    * **List these companies directly after this heading, for example: "Top Companies to Target for this Role:\n1. Company A\n2. Company B..."**
    * Suggest reputable companies that frequently hire for a "${role}" position, especially those known for a good tech culture or relevant projects.

3.  **General Most Asked Questions for this Role (Minimum 5 questions):**
    * List common, fundamental interview questions typically asked for a "${role}" position that are not directly personalized to the resume, covering core concepts, data structures, algorithms, or system design.

Resume:
${resumeText}

Format your output clearly with distinct, bolded headers for "Personalized Interview Questions", "Top 5 Companies to Target for this Role", and "General Most Asked Questions for this Role". Use numbered lists for all questions and for the company suggestions. Do not include any extra introductory or concluding text outside these structured sections.
